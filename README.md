data structures and algorithms related projects


Q. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

A.   During the term, there were three pseudocode assignments. The objective of each assignment was to write the pseudocode for three diffrerent types of data structures with the data structures being: Vectors, Hashtables, and Binary Search Trees. While writing the pseudocode for each data structure, the student gets to observe if the method being used to efficient or not. Project one is when the student writes the pseudocode for Project two which is the actual code. I personally chose the vector data structure as it is the most efficient and clean data structure. To answer the question, the objective of this course was to learn and find the most efficient data structure to complete project two in which the code has to be able to read uploaded data, write it in alphanumeric order, and print at the request of the user.

Q. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  
A.   Different data structures have different uses. The three data structures that we went over this term each had their own assignment to give the student an overview of the advantages as well as the disadvatages of each data structure. After visualizing the pros and cons of each data structure, the student has to select the data structure that they thought was best fit for performing the tasks required in Project Two.

Q. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

A.   One of the few downsides of this class was that it's primarily self taught and therefore any questions that arise might not have an immediate answer. Thankfully, Youtube, Google and the textbook can sometimes have the answers to different questions and it is up to the student to realize how the concepts are similar and use it to answer their immediate questions accordingly.

Q. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

A.   Having to compare and contrast the three data structures in this course has really opened my eyes towards being innovative when designing and developing programs. I am a junior web developer for work and I have always stuck to what I know without looking into more efficient methods. As we can see throughout the course, the three different data structures each have their pros and cons. However, you pick the method where the pros far outweigh the cons which leads to a far more efficent way of programming
  
  
Q. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

A.  This project has taught me how to write programs in the most efficient way by writing code that is editable and leaving comments so just in case someone other than me has to take a look at it, they will understand what the code means. The code also has to be adaptable since software changes all the time, therefore the less that has to be changed when future workers are going back on the code, the better. Even if it is the writer of the code themselves, sometimes they will forget the most simple of variables and that is why it is always good to leave notes after writing code.
